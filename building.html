<h1 style="color: blue; text-align: center;">House Build</h1>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Every two years I take on a housing project where I start a new build from scratch. The process has been an incredible amount of fun while giving me ideas for my future dream home. This also provides me somewhere to live for two years and then sell for profit.</h2>
<div class="HouseBuildingPage">
<p style="text-align: center;">The first step with every house build of course is to select a floor plan you are comfortable with. This time around I went with a ranch style with a main floor and a basement. This allowed me for extra large rooms and a lot of open space to make the home feel larger. The next step was to pour the concrete. Once the concrete had dried we could finally start framing the house.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center;">As you can see in this photo of the unfinished basement the framing has been built on top of the concrete. Also noteable is the hvac piping and electrical is starting to be weaved into the ceiling.</p>
    <img src="Images/Framing Kitchen.jpg"  class="align-center" width="600" height="450">
    <p style="text-align: center;">Upstairs the framing of the main floor has begun. Windows are being installed as electrical is being completed.</p>
    <img src="Images/Framing Structure.jpg"  class="align-center" width="600" height="450">
    <p style="text-align: center;">Framing of the entire structure is now complete and we have the first real look at what the house is going to look like once completed. </p>
    <img src="Images/Kitchen halfway.jpg"  class="align-center" width="600" height="450">
    <p style="text-align: center;">With framing, electrical, and hvac systems completed insulation, drywall, floors, and appliances are installed to make the house get a more completed look. </p>

    <p style="text-align: center;">Shown here is the completed kitchen and upstairs living room.</p>
    <img src="Images/Downstairs Finished.jpg"  class="align-center" width="600" height="450">

    <img src="Images/House final.jpg"  class="align-center" width="600" height="450">
    <p style="text-align: center;">Finally, a completed build of a new home. With more than nine months of work invested it is finally ready to be lived in. </p>
