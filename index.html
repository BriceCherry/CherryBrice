    <h2 style="text-align: center; color:blue;">About Me</h2>

    <p style="text-align:left; text-indent: 20px;">Hello, I am <strong>Brice Cherry</strong>. A little about me, I have been in Colorado for most of my life, however, my father was in the Air Force so we moved around a lot prior to his retirement. I have lived overseas in Japan and South Korea. I have been to 6 of the 7 continents, with plans to go to the 7th in February of 2023. I love gaming, football, and spending time with friends and family. I have a passion for all things tech and enjoy tinkering with programs and websites. Since I have been 19 I have had an obsession with investing in property and money markets. I pride myself on self teaching and learning through doing.</p>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;color: blue;">Why Software Engineering? </h2>
    <p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 20px;">I want to be a software engineer because I value the creative expression it allows us. We get to create functioning programs with our hands and a machine to do any number of tasks. I have tinkered with every piece of technology I have ever recieved, and writing programs for technology seems like the appropriate next step. The idea of doing software engineering excites me, and it pushes me harder to get into this program.</p>
