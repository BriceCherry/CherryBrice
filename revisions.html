    <h1 style="text-align: center; color: blue;">Revisions To Project</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;">I asked Shawn Cannon who is also in the program for a 2nd set of eyes on my website project. We focused in on the main page and made some significant changes. The page prior was a little messy and dull with no real styling elements. I added a background image, border for text with padding, corrected margins on page to make the page tighter and appear more clean..</p>
    <p style="text-align: center; ">Picture included below.</p>
    <img src="Images/Home page prior to correction.PNG" width="650" class="align-center"  />
    <p style="color: white; text-align: center;">With her 2nd set of eyes I was able to get a better feel on what layouts look better. She thought it would look more professional if I have the pictures and text centered. This gave my site a much more aesthetically pleasing feel, and I personally loved the changes</p>
